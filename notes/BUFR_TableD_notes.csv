29,"In this instance, the term ""thinning"" refers to a method that may be applied to select a subset of levels from a model that may have many native vertical levels. Selecting only a subset reduces the size of the pseudo-sounding, at the possible cost of information loss and extra processing.",
30,"In this sequence for representation of radiosonde descent data, indication of standard levels using the extended vertical sounding significance (0 08 042) is not mandatory.",
31,"Integer, assigned by the operator, incremented for each new transect (i.e. all drops have the same transect number while the ship is moving from one end point of the line to the other end point; as soon as the ship arrived to port and goes back to start a new transect then transect number is incremented). The initial value and subsequent values for transect numbers do not matter provided that each new transect by a ship on a line has a transect number higher than previous transect numbers for the same line and the same ship. In case a single cruise follows more than one SOOP line in a row, then the transect number should be incremented each time the cruise changes line.",
32,"It could be argued that, as only additions are possible, only complete lines should be allowed; but it is conceivable that local areas will require changes as well as additions, so it is better and in any case clearer to provide descriptions for all the fields.",00
33,"It is better to use different Class 00 descriptors for the defining and defined elements, in the same way as different descriptors correspond to pressure considered as a coordinate and pressure measured at a given point; otherwise special rules would be needed to interpret such message. Entries 0 00 010 to 0 00 012 define F, X and Y for Tables B and D; entry 0 00 030 is a descriptor used as data and provides the F, X and Y values defining a sequence for Table D entries.",00

Count = 0 (full directional spectra) or 1 (non-directional spectra or partial directional spectra). Partial directional spectra have only one direction per wave number band.,
40,"Non-surface levels on the modelâ€™s native vertical coordinate are transposed to pressure coordinate. This makes the levels more readily intelligible for human interpretation and easier to use by generic display applications. The levels may correspond exactly to native model levels, or be interpolated between model levels to pressure levels chosen by the generating centre.",

In this case, all values reported for 0 33 042 shall be ""missing"". (b) Via a single horizontal section with an appropriate value reported for 0 33 042, as follows. In all such cases, the corresponding horizontal section description applies throughout the entire region.

(c) Via two replications of the same horizontal section at the same reported flight level, in order to indicate a region extending both below and above (and including!) the reported flight level.
