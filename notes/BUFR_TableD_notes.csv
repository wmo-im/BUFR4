31,"Integer, assigned by the operator, incremented for each new transect (i.e. all drops have the same transect number while the ship is moving from one end point of the line to the other end point; as soon as the ship arrived to port and goes back to start a new transect then transect number is incremented). The initial value and subsequent values for transect numbers do not matter provided that each new transect by a ship on a line has a transect number higher than previous transect numbers for the same line and the same ship. In case a single cruise follows more than one SOOP line in a row, then the transect number should be incremented each time the cruise changes line.",

33,"It is better to use different Class 00 descriptors for the defining and defined elements, in the same way as different descriptors correspond to pressure considered as a coordinate and pressure measured at a given point; otherwise special rules would be needed to interpret such message.

Count = 0 (full directional spectra) or 1 (non-directional spectra or partial directional spectra). Partial directional spectra have only one direction per wave number band.,
40,"Non-surface levels on the model’s native vertical coordinate are transposed to pressure coordinate.

In this case, all values reported for 0 33 042 shall be ""missing"". (b) Via a single horizontal section with an appropriate value reported for 0 33 042, as follows.
