34,"Code figures for generic precipitation (code figures 140-148) are arranged in order of increasing complexity. For example, a very simple station that can sense only the presence or absence of precipitation would use code figure 140 (precipitation). At the next level, an automatic station capable of sensing amount but not type would use code figure 141 or 142. An automatic station capable of sensing gross type (liquid, solid, freezing) and amount would use code figures 143-148. An automatic station capable of reporting actual types of precipitation (e.g. drizzle rain), but not the amount, would use the appropriate whole decile number (e.g. 150 for generic drizzle, 160 for generic rain)."

41,"Freezing level is the level at which temperature first decreases to 0 °C. The criteria for the selection of freezing level in upper-air observations are:(a) If the surface temperature is not lower than 0 °C when the radiosonde is released, then the lowest level at which the temperature first decreases to 0 °C will be selected as the freezing level.(b) If the surface temperature is equal to 0 °C, then the surface level will be the freezing level.(c) If during observation there is no level at which the temperature equals 0 °C, then the closest two levels between which the temperature crosses from a positive to a negative value should be used to interpolate the freezing-level temperature equal to 0 °C.(d) The following elements will be calculated for the freezing level: time, elevation, pressure, humidity,dew point temperature, dewpoint depression, and deviation of longitude and latitude."
