At the next level, an automatic station capable of sensing amount but not type would use code figure 141 or 142. An automatic station capable of sensing gross type (liquid, solid, freezing) and amount would use code figures 143-148. An automatic station capable of reporting actual types of precipitation (e.g. drizzle rain), but not the amount, would use the appropriate whole decile number (e.g. 150 for generic drizzle, 160 for generic rain)."
