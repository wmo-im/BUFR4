186,"The convective available potential energy (CAPE) defines the maximum energy available to an ascending air parcel. CAPE is also referred to as positive buoyancy."
187,"The total totals (TT) index is defined by the combination of the vertical totals (VT = T_850 * T_500) and the cross totals (CT = Td_850 - T_500), resulting in TT = T_850 + Td_850 - 2 * T_500."
188,"The S index (STT) is defined as STT = TT - (T_700 + Td_700) - A, where TT indicates total totals index and A depends on the vertical totals (VT = T_850 * T_500) such that it penalizes cases with low values of VT (that is, low vertical temperature gradients):  A = 0 (if VT > 25); 2 (if 22 <= VT <= 25); 6 (if VT < 22)."
189,"The fog threat (FT) index indicates the potential for radiation fog and is based on the definition of fog point (FP), which is the temperature at which radiation fog will form. The fog point is determined by following the saturation mixing ratio line from the dew point curve at the lifting condensation level (LCL) to the surface temperature. Then, the fog threat is given by the difference of the wet bulb potential temperature at 850 mb (theta_WB850) and the fog point: FT = theta_WB850 - FP. The potential for radiation fog is low for FT > 3, while it becomes high for FT < 0."
190,"The microburst day potential index (MDPI) is based on the vertical profiles of equivalent potential temperature and is defined follows: MDPI  = (Max thetae - Min thetae_aloft) / CT where Max thetae = Maximum  thetae in the lowest 150 hPa, Minthetae_aloft = Minimum thetae between 650 and 500 hPa, and CT = critical threshold (or normalization factor), currently defined as 30 K. MDPI was designed to determine likely and unlikely environments for downbursts. For MDPI values greater than or equal to 1, microbursts are likely."
191,"The TQ index (TQ) is used to assess the potential for lowtopped convection. It is defined as TQ = (T_850 + Td_850) - 1.7 * (T_700)."
